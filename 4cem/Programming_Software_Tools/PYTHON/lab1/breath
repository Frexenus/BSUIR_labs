I breathe clouds beneath my window
I see rockets in the sky
I feel satellites in limbo
I breathe oxygen up high

I load lead inside my engine
Lead and alcohol
On the radio depending
I sign the protocol
Hail the audience the media
People everywhere
In the hours ahead i’ll see your

Green Biosphere
Clean Biosphere
Castles in the air
Climbing the stair
Way to heaven when

I breathe clouds beneath my window
I see rockets in the sky
I feel satellites in limbo
I breathe oxygen up high

I’ve been trained to navigate my
Futurist balloon
After years a week will see me
Landing on the moon
Raise a banner on the planets
Life grows everywhere
In the manner of the mission

Green Biosphere
Clean Biosphere
Castles in the air
Climbing the stair
Way to heaven when

I breathe clouds beneath my window
I see rockets in the sky
I feel satellites in limbo
I breathe oxygen up high

Green Biosphere
Clean Biosphere
Castles in the air
Climbing the stair
Way to heaven when

I breathe clouds beneath my window
I see rockets in the sky
I feel satellites in limbo
I breathe oxygen up high
